This page highlights my leadership roles and initiatives in various organizations, showcasing my commitment to fostering growth, collaboration, and innovation.

### The Moroccan Mathematical Community (MMC)
I co-founded this association in March 2022 with other peers and friends as a continuum of the EMPIMO network, with a new wider scope and higher vision: to foster an active, inventive, and creative Moroccan society by democratizing access to mathematics, bridging it with Morocco's rich culture, and unlocking its potential for sustainable human development.

I've served as **president of the community since 2022** and still do. During these years, I've contributed to the establishment of the community's foundations:
* **Foundation and paperwork:** writing the first bylaws and internal regulation, legal declaration of the association, creation of the association's bank account.
* **Identity and brand:** vision, mission, logo, color palette, values.
* **Internal structure and workflow:** sub-teams and internal management rules, HR strategy.
* **Community culture development:** internal rituals, vocabulary, authentic ideas, collective social activities.
* **Digital presence and marketing:** social media pages, Discord server and WhatsApp community, podcast.
* **Collaborations and event organization:** 3 partnerships and a major math event (Pi Day).

### ENSIAS AI Club
I was nominated **deputy president charged with collaborations** in the ENSIAS AI Club during the mandate of 2022-2023. During this period, I succeeded in arranging 3 partnerships with the ENIM Astronomines Club, the Moroccan Mathematical Community, and the AMETOP (IAV).

The collaboration with ENIM was rich with mutual activities. Thanks to the SpaceML project, we've organized together joint training sessions, a scientific webinar with Dr. Evgeny Smirnov (PhD in Math and Astronomy at the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade, Serbia ; Founder of 4xxi), and a visit to the Faculty of Science planetarium. Among others, I also successfully got the club's first-ever sponsorship agreement with SoGé Bank for its first event, the AI Day 2023.

### ENSIAS IT Club
I was nominated **deputy president charged with collaborations** in the ENSIAS IT Club during the mandate of 2022-2023. During this period, I succeeded in arranging a collaboration partnership (Coders Union) with the Mines IT Club and the FSR CP Club and organizing the 1st edition of the CP Camp during Ramadan 1443. A year later, I helped unofficially to extend the network to count 3 other schools and clubs: INPT CIT, EMI IT AcadEMI, and ESI CODE, in the context of the IT Clubs Summit in 2023.

### CP Square Initiative
CP² or Competitive Programming for Preparatory Classes is an independent Moroccan educational initiative that I started and directed after finishing CPGE studies in 2021. I managed it with a team of Moroccan CP enthusiasts from CPGE and from engineering schools. This program aimed to promote the culture of CP in Moroccan CPGE through the organization of lectures, conferences, contests, and training sessions online and also encourage the creation of CP scholar clubs in CPGE centers.

We managed to reach a large audience of CPGE students and push the presence of CPGE in Moroccan CP contests from less than 1% to 11% of the total participants in less than one year. The network also had a physical presence in 3 CPGEs (MY Rabat, SF Sale, and MD Fes). Unfortunately, this initiative is now frozen after 2 years of activity due to a lack of volunteers to help me supervise and animate it.

### Federation of Scholar Clubs of Moulay Youssef (FCS)
I co-founded this Union of scholar clubs in May 2018 during my high school studies at Lycée Moulay Youssef Rabat with 16 other colleagues and friends. The objective was to coordinate between the different clubs of the school, create a more cohesive and collaborative environment for the students of the high school, and achieve better coordination with the school's administration and other external actors with the standardization of communication channels.

I was the 1st leader of this student organization during my graduation year (2018/2019) and continued serving with its board as an advisor and scientific trainer during my 2 years of preparatory studies in the CPGE of the same school.

### Equipe Marocaine de Préparation aux IMO (EMPIMO)
I co-founded this hybrid network in July 2017 with Mohamed Jamal to prepare for the IMO when I was in high school (11th grade). I kept leading the EMPMO until its death in September 2020 post-COVID crisis.

During these 3 years, I launched and supervised several programs and events, namely:
* **Junior Combinatorial Olympiad (OCJ):** a national competition in combinatorial mathematics for middle school students.
* **Olympiad Mathematics Forum (FMO):** an exchange forum between several actors in the field of mathematical Olympiads.
* **Great Digital Media Library (GMN):** a website organizing a wide range of mathematical documents.
* **Junior Mathematical Olympiad Circle (CMOJ):** pilot class of students.
* **School Clubs Network:** union and coordination between 11 mathematics clubs.

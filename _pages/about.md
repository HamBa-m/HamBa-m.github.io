I'm an **Artificial Intelligence (AI) research engineer** who graduated from the Higher National School of Computer Sciences (ENSIAS) at Rabat, working at the intersection of cutting-edge research and real-world applications. Currently, I'm pursuing a PhD at the College of Computing in the University Mohammed VI Polytechnic (UM6P) focused on adversarial attacks and defenses in multi-agent reinforcement learning systems, exploring their integration with bio-inspired algorithms and their applications in Agentic AI and 6G networks.

Since starting my AI journey in 2021, I've gained diverse experience across industries like renewable energies, climatology, astronomy, rocket science, satellites and UAVs, medicine, supply chain, construction, education, sports, retail and sales, and others. Likewise, I've accumulated expertise working with multiple AI, data science, and computer science subareas and techniques.

I also offer **AI consulting services**, helping businesses, organizations, and even individuals leverage advanced AI solutions to solve complex challenges, integrate AI in their workflow, or simply learn how to use new digital services and technologies.

Beyond my professional work, I've pursued passion projects for learning and fun, earning top ranks in scientific and entrepreneurial competitions while collaborating with peers from various fields. I've also been engaged in many school clubs in my past schools, where I developed a great network of friends and peers, as well as many soft skills, most importantly communication, teaching, leadership, and project management.

As a competitive programmer since 2019, I'm active on platforms like Codeforces, Kattis, and the Moroccan Competitive Programming Events like JNJD and Game of Codes, with a focus on graphs, probabilities, combinatorics, and geometry.

I'm also a proud Moroccan social activist, dedicated to empowering my community by promoting knowledge to address socio-economic inequalities, advance human development, and preserve Moroccan cultural identity through accessible mathematical content and logical reasoning. I co-founded the **Moroccan Mathematical Community** in 2022 to drive this mission.

In my free time, I explore art and meditation, from painting and sculpture to writing philosophical essays.
